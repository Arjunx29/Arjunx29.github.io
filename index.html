    <h1>Creating a Repository on GitHub</h1>
    <p>Creating a repository on GitHub is a straightforward process that allows you to start managing your project's code and collaborate with others. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating a new repository on GitHub:</p>
    
    <h2>1. Sign In to GitHub</h2>
    <p>First, sign in to your GitHub account. If you don’t have an account, you’ll need to create one by visiting GitHub and signing up.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Navigate to New Repository</h2>
    <p>Once signed in, you can create a new repository by:</p>
    <p>Clicking on the <strong>+</strong> icon in the top right corner of the GitHub interface.</p>
    <p>Selecting New repository from the dropdown menu.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Repository Details</h2>
    <p>On the new repository page, you will need to provide some details:</p>
    <p><strong>Repository Name: Choose a unique name for your repository. The name should be descriptive and relevant to the project.</p>
    <p><strong>Description : Provide a brief description of your project. This is optional but recommended for clarity.</p>
    <p>Public/Private: Decide whether your repository will be public (visible to everyone) or private (only you and selected collaborators can view it).</p>
    
    <h2>4. Initialize Repository</h2>
    <p>You have a few optional settings to initialize your repository:</p>
    <p>Add a README file: This is a markdown file where you can describe your project, its purpose, and how to use it. It’s a good practice to include a README.</p>
    <p>Add .gitignore: A .gitignore file specifies which files and directories to ignore in your repository. You can choose a template suitable for your project type (e.g., Python, Node).</p>
    <p>Choose a license: Adding a license determines how others can use, modify, and distribute your project. GitHub provides several common open-source licenses to choose from.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Create Repository</h2>
    <p>After filling out the necessary details, click the Create repository button. Your new repository is now created, and you can start adding code to it.</p>
    
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Creating a repository on GitHub is the first step in managing your project's source code and collaborating with others. By following these steps, you can set up a new repository and begin organizing your project effectively.</p>
