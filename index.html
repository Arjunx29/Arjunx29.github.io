    <h1>GitHub Basics</h1>
    <p>GitHub is a platform that allows developers to collaborate on projects, manage code, and track changes. It uses Git, a version control system, to track code changes and facilitate collaboration. Below are the key concepts and features of GitHub.</p>
    <h2>1. Repositories</h2>
    <p>A repository, or repo, is a storage space for your project. It contains all the project files and the history of changes made to those files. Repositories can be public (open to everyone) or private (restricted access).
    </p>
    <h2>2. Branches</h2>
    <p>Branches are used to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment with new ideas in isolation from the main project. The default branch is usually called "main" or "master." You can create new branches to work on separate tasks and then merge them back into the main branch once they're complete.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Commits
    </h2>
    <p>A commit is a snapshot of the project's files at a specific point in time. It includes a message describing the changes made. Commits help track the history of changes and understand the evolution of the project.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Pull Requests</h2>
    <p>Pull requests are used to propose changes to a repository. They allow you to discuss changes with collaborators, review code, and ensure that the proposed changes are tested before being merged into the main branch. Pull requests are essential for collaborative workflows.
    </p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>GitHub is an essential tool for modern software development, providing version control, collaboration features, and project management tools. Understanding its basic concepts and features can significantly enhance your ability to work on both individual and team projects.
